# AutoSendMessage
Application that Auto Sends Keys / Messages with the cooldown you put.

You are able to send the message you want.
If you want to send Special keys like "F5" you have to put in message {F5} and that it. 
You should know that the Cooldown it's in miliseconds so you need to change the numbers like:
1 second its equal to 1000 miliseconds so if you want to send a message or key every 5 seconds it is equal to 5000 miliseconds.
